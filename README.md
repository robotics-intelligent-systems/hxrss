# Robotic Surgery System

Surgeyos is an open-source initiative unifying hardware, mechanical designs, electronics, software, and AI for medical robotics, VR simulation, and beyond. The ROS for Medical Robotics (ROS-MED) Project is an open-source software project to provide an open-source software platform for medical robotics research. SurRoL: An Open-source Reinforcement Learning Centered and dVRK Compatible Platform for Surgical Robot Learning. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. OpenSim is a freely available and user-extensible software system that allows users to develop models of musculoskeletal structures, create dynamic motion simulations, and can be used to assist in surgery planning for children with cerebral palsy. iMSTK is an open-source C++-based software toolkit for real-time physics-based surgical simulations. SOFA is an open-source framework for interactive mechanical simulation, with an emphasis on biomechanics and robotics. Gazebo is an open-source 2D/3D robotics simulator. Cover: a safe subset of C++ on the JVM using Graal/Truffle. openVidu is a powerful platform for developing real-time WebRTC applications. Clara is a forward-chaining rules engine written in Clojure(Script) with Java interoperability. O3DE, a real-time open source 3D engine, can be used to create robotic simulations and immersive 3D worlds. 3dbiotechDentalCAD is a 3D modeling software focused on the dental sector based on the open source project Open Dental. ODC is the open source dental CAD solution for Blender. OMWebbook is an interactive notebook and a web-based Modelica-Toolbox. The UEFMI plugin allows for the use of dynamic simulation models via Functional Mockup Units (FMUs) directly in an Unreal Engine project.
